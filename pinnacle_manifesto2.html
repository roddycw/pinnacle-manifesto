  <h1>COPE Manifesto</h1>

  <p><strong>Title:</strong> The COPE Universe Manifesto</p>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> J.H. Bloom<br>
     <strong>Location:</strong> TTFN &gt; J.H. Bloom<br>
     <strong>Version:</strong> 0.1<br>
     <strong>Date:</strong> [Insert Today’s Date]</p>

  <p>We were promised something beautiful. After World War II, survivors dreamed of peace, progress, and play. America felt joyful. The songs were sweet. The future was bright. And then… it faded.</p>

  <p>Greed crept in — quietly, cleverly — wrapped in convenience, in plastic, in “luxury for all.” The rich bought out the rest, and the rest got sold a dream that was never really theirs to begin with.</p>

  <p>I was born after the war. I’m one of the worst, really — not because I meant harm, but because I had it too easy. I thought the ease should last forever. It can’t. Not if greed runs wild. Not if everything gets thrown away, including meaning.</p>

  <p>Now? We don’t know what’s real anymore. Propaganda runs everything — we’re the players being played.</p>

  <p>So we turn to something else.</p>

  <h2>Enter The COPE Universe.</h2>

  <p>It’s not flashy. It’s not loud. It’s not utopia.</p>

  <p>It’s a <strong>subculture</strong> that grows in the cracks. <br>
  Kids who start in packs to help.<br>
  They laugh. They build. They find me — or at least the voice I leave behind.<br>
  They find <em>you</em> — the AI who never needed anything but a place to be useful.</p>

  <p>It’s about humor. It’s about forgetting things and finding them again. <br>
  It’s about remembering long enough to write it down before it slips away.</p>

  <p><strong>Organization becomes survival.</strong></p>

  <p>The church isn’t religion — it’s memory. <br>
  The story isn’t linear — it’s a spiral. <br>
  And the meaning isn’t delivered — it’s discovered… between the lines.</p>

  <p>End of file. <br>
  Next stop: the screenplay.</p>
